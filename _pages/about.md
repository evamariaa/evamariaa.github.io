Hi there! My name is Eva-Maria Ahrer but please call me Evie! My pronouns are she/her and I just started as a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Atmospheric Physics of Exoplanets (APEx) department, Max Planck Institute for Astronomy (MPIA) in Heidelberg, Germany. Prior to that I did my PhD at the University of Warwick under supervision of Prof Peter Wheatley.

I'm interested in all kinds of atmospheric observations of exoplanets, from optical to mid-infrared wavelength ranges and currently with a focus on hot Jupiters and sub-Neptunes. I've used both ground-based telescopes such as NTT and space telescopes for my research, but my recently I mainly worked on JWST observations.  


I'm very involved in outreach and ED&I activities. One outreach activity very close to my heart is the International Astronomical Youth Camp (IAYC), a three-week summer camp for 16-24 year olds, where I got to know a lot of amazing people that helped me figure out this academic life. Now I got to be on the organising team and inspire young minds!
