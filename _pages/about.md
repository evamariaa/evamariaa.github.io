Hi there! My name is Eva-Maria Ahrer but please call me Evie! My pronouns are she/her and I just defended my PhD thesis at the University of Warwick. 

I just started as a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Atmospheric Physics of Exoplanets (APEx) department, Max Planck Institute for Astronomy (MPIA) in Heidelberg, Germany. 

I'm interested in all kinds of atmospheric observations of exoplanets, from optical to mid-infrared wavelength ranges and currently with a focus on hot Jupiters. I've used both ground-based telescopes such as NTT and space telescopes such as JWST for my research. 


I'm very involved in outreach and ED&I activities. One outreach activity very close to my heart is the International Astronomical Youth Camp (IAYC), a three-week summer camp for 16-24 year olds, where I got to know a lot of amazing people that helped me figure out this academic life. Now I got to be on the organising team and inspire young minds!
