My name is Eva-Maria Ahrer but most people just call me Evie! My pronouns are she/her and I am a Minerva Junior Research Group Leader at the Atmospheric Physics of Exoplanets (APEx) department, Max Planck Institute for Astronomy (MPIA) in Heidelberg, Germany. 

### Research Summary
My group and my work focuses on observations of exoplanets, from hot Jupiters to sub-Neptunes and characterising their atmospheres. 
We use facilities like the JWST as well as ground-based telescopes to collect transmission spectra and identify absorptions from molecules and atoms as well as clouds and hazes in exoplanet atmospheres. 


### Beyond Research 
I'm very involved in outreach and ED&I activities. One outreach activity very close to my heart is the <a href="iayc.org"> International Astronomical Youth Camp (IAYC)</a>, a three-week summer camp for 16-24 year olds, where I got to know a lot of amazing people that helped me figure out this academic life. Now I got to be on the organising team and inspire young minds!
I'm also keen on giving talks at schools, astronomy societies, etc. (either English or German) so please reach out if interested!
