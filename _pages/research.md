I'm interested in all kinds of atmospheric observations of exoplanets!

Research questions I'm interested in:
- (How) Can we reliably link planet formation and exoplanet atmospheres?
- Can we determine morning and evening sides of hot Jupiters, characterising their 2D and 3D structures?
- What kind of diversity exists for sub-Neptune atmospheres? And how is it linked to their formation, migration and evolution (e.g., regarding the radius gap or Neptune desert)?

My expertise:
- Data reduction and analysis of exoplanets and their atmospheres; I'm actively involved in developing reduction tools, e.g., with the Eureka! and Tiberius pipelines. 
- With a focus on JWST! but also ground-based telescopes such as the NTT at La Silla, or the Calar Alto 2.2m.
- Atmospheric modelling and characterisation, mainly using petitRADTRANS.
