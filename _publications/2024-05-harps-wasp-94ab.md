excerpt: "We present high spectral resolution observations of the hot Jupiter WASP-94 A b using the HARPS instrument on ESO's 3.6-m telescope in La Silla, Chile. We probed for Na absorption in its atmosphere as well as constrained the previously reported misaligned retrograde orbit using the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect. Additionally, we undertook a combined atmospheric retrieval analysis with previously published low-resolution data. We confirm the retrograde orbit as well as constrain the orbital misalignment with our measurement of a projected spin-orbit obliquity of λ = 123.0 ± 3.0°. We find a tentative detection of Na absorption in the atmosphere of WASP-94 A b, independent of the treatment of the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect in our analysis (3.6σ and 4.4σ). We combine our HARPS high-resolution data with low-resolution data from the literature and find that while the posterior distribution of the Na abundance results in a tighter constraint than using a single data set, the detection significance does not improve (3.2σ), which we attribute to degeneracies between the low- and high-resolution data."
