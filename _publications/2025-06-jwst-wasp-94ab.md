excerpt: "We present a JWST NIRSpec/G395H transmission spectrum from 2.8 - 5.1 µm of WASP-94Ab, an inflated hot Jupiter with a retrograde misaligned orbit around its F-type host star. We find a relatively cloud-free atmosphere, with absorption features of H2O and CO2 at detection significances of ~4σ and ~11σ, respectively. In addition, we detect tentative evidence of CO absorption at ~3σ, as well as hints of sulphur with the detection of H2S at a ~2.5σ confidence level. Our favoured equilibrium chemistry model determines a C/O ratio of  0.49+0.08−0.13  for WASP-94Ab's atmosphere, which is substellar compared to the star's C/O ratio of 0.68 ± 0.10. The retrieved atmospheric metallicity is similar to the star's metallicity as both are ~2 × solar. We find that this sub-stellar C/O ratio and stellar metallicity can be best explained by pebble accretion or planetesimal accretion in combination with large-distance migration of the planet."
