excerpt: "We present an optical transmission spectrum for WASP-94A b, the first atmospheric characterization of this highly-inflated hot Jupiter. We observed the planet transit spectroscopically with the EFOSC2 instrument on the ESO New Technology Telescope (NTT) at La Silla, Chile: the first use of NTT/EFOSC2 for transmission spectroscopy. The resulting transmission spectrum, spanning a wavelength range of 3800-7140 Å, exhibits a sodium absorption with a significance of 4.9σ, suggesting a relatively cloud-free atmosphere. We also detect a steep slope in the blue end of the transmission spectrum, indicating the presence of Rayleigh scattering in the atmosphere of WASP-94A b."
