title: "The HARPS search for southern extra-solar planets - XLV. Two Neptune mass planets orbiting HD 13808: a study of stellar activity modelling's impact on planet detection"
collection: publications
excerpt: "We present a comprehensive analysis of 10 yr of HARPS radial velocities (RVs) of the K2V dwarf star HD 13808, which has previously been reported to host two unconfirmed planet candidates. We show that the use of overly simplistic stellar activity models that are not well-motivated physically can lead to spurious 'detections' of planetary signals that are almost certainly not real. Given the robustness and precision with which we can characterize two planetary signals, we deem them secure planet detections. In particular, we find two planets orbiting HD 13808 at distances of 0.11, 0.26 au with periods of 14.2, 53.8 d, and minimum masses of 11, 10 Earth masses."
