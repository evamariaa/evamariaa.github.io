excerpt: "Hot Jupiters and their atmospheres are prime targets for transmission spectroscopy due to their extended atmospheres and the corresponding large signal-to-noise, providing the best possible constraints for the atmospheric carbon-to-oxygen (C/O) ratio and metallicity of exoplanets. Within BOWIE-ALIGN, we aim to compare JWST spectra of a sample of orbitally aligned and misaligned hot Jupiters orbiting F-type stars to probe the link between hot Jupiter atmospheres and planet formation history. Here, we present a near-infrared transmission spectrum of the aligned planet KELT-7b using one transit observed with JWST NIRSpec/G395H. We find weak features, only tentative evidence for H2O and CO2 in the atmosphere of KELT-7b. This poses a challenge to constrain the atmospheric properties of KELT-7b and two possible scenarios emerge from equilibrium chemistry and free chemistry retrievals: a high-altitude cloud deck muting all features or an extremely low metallicity atmosphere, respectively. The retrieved C/O ratios from our data reductions range from  0.43-0.74, while the atmospheric metallicity is suggested to be solar to super-solar (1-16Ã—solar). Although these wide constraints prevent detailed conclusions about KELT-7b's formation history, a solar-to-super-solar metallicity would imply the accretion of solid material during its formation, which is valuable information for the survey's wider goals of understanding the relative importance of gaseous to solid accretion."
