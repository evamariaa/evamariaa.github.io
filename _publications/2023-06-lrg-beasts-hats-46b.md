title: "LRG-BEASTS: evidence for clouds in the transmission spectrum of HATS-46 b"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2023-06-lrg-beasts-hats-46b
excerpt: "We have performed low-resolution ground-based spectroscopy of HATS-46 b in transmission, using the EFOSC2 instrument on the ESO New Technology Telescope (NTT). The transmission spectrum does not show strong absorption features and retrievals favour a cloudy model, ruling out a clear atmosphere with 3.0σ confidence. We also place a conservative upper limit on the sodium abundance under the alternative scenario of a clear atmosphere."
